# OBD-II-Graph
Graphing program for OBD-II code scanners.  This includes a driver for the code scanner, sample data files, and the graphing program.

Download, unzip and install the Code_Scanner_Graph.zip.  When you run it, load any of the data files, show graph, and select sensors.

To use your own data:
	1.  Connect you scan tool to an OBD-II compliant vehicle (1996 and newer)
	2.  Select 'Live Data' and 'Store Data', or something that sounds like that
	3.  Collect the data from the vehicle, then unplug the scanner from you vehicle
	4.  Plug the scan tool into your computer, it should allow you to save the data files
	5.  I named my data files ending with '.dat'.  You don't have to.
